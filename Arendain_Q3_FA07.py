# 1: Using an array helped me analyze the data more easily by helping me categorize each part. 
# It also allowed me to simplify my code through functions and overall made my experience better.
# Usin arrays helped me put everything together and help me easily find averages, totals, and more.

# 2: Finding the total for each row was quite simple. Although it was confusing at first, I was able
# to figure out what function I needed to use to get the total and how to use it on the corresponding row.
# I was a little loss for finding the average but in the end I managed to figure it out.
